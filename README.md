# 01-HW-Code-Refactor

## The Project

```
Needed to update code using semantic HTML elements. 
Added necessary <nav>, <header>, <main>, <aside>, and <footer> elements. 
Added alt text to images. 
Added meta data in the <head> tag.
Spaced code out a bit to reflect different sections of the website for better readability.
